FLIB: A Fragment Library Generation Software
############################################

Saulo de Oliveira - February - 2015
Current Version: 1.0

INSTALLATION
############

Change to the directory where you have extracted the contents of "Flib.tgz"
and type:

$ make

This will generate the executable "Flib".


DEPENDENCIES
############

Flib does not require any additional software to be executed. 

However, Flib requires 4 input files and accepts a 5th optional file:

1- PDB_ID.fasta.txt : The fasta sequence of the target.
2- PDB_ID.fasta.ss  : The predicted secondary structure of the target as output
			    by PSIPRED
3- PDB_ID.spXout	  : The predicted torsion angles of the target as output by SPINE-X.
4- PDB_ID.hhr	  : Threading hits as generated by HHBlits.
5- PDB_ID.homol	  : A text file listing all the homologs to the target (one PDB_ID per line).

An example of each of these files for protein 1AIU can be found in the 
contents of Flib.tgz.

On top of the required input files, Flib also requires a local version of 
the Protein Data Bank (PDB). All the ".pdb" files should be grouped under the
same folder and their IDs should be in lower case. 

Local versions of the following software can be incorporated into Flib's pipeline:

1- PSIPRED
2- HHSearch/HHBlits
3- SPINE-X
4- BLAST

To generate a SAINT2-compliant library, the Python script "process_new.py" should be run.

This script requires Python 2.6 or higher and the Biopython Module.

CONFIGURATION
#############

In order to configure Flib, alter the path names on the file "pipeline.sh".

Make sure to provide the correct paths to Flib and to the local version of the PDB.

If using any local versions of the software described in the previous section,
make sure to alter the respective flags to "true" as instructed by the comments 
on the script "pipeline.sh".

The 4 required input files should be placed in the same directory as the Flib 
executables.

EXAMPLE
#######

To generate fragment libraries using Flib, you should use the script "pipeline.sh"
as follows:

./pipeline 1AIU

The following example should generate the fragment library file "1AIU.lib".
