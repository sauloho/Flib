============================================
Flib: A Fragment Library Generation Software
============================================

Saulo de Oliveira - February - 2015
Current Version: 1.01

1. INSTALLATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change to the directory where you have extracted the contents of ``Flib.tgz``
and type:

.. code:: bash
   
   $> cd src
   $> make
   $> make install

This will generate the executable ``bin/Flib``.


2. DEPENDENCIES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Flib does not require any additional software to be executed. 

However, Flib requires four input files and accepts a fifth optional file:

1. PDB_ID.fasta.txt : The fasta sequence of the target.
2. PDB_ID.fasta.ss  : The predicted secondary structure of the target as output by PSIPRED
3. PDB_ID.spXout    : The predicted torsion angles of the target as output by SPINE-X.
4. PDB_ID.hhr       : Threading hits as generated by HHBlits.
5. PDB_ID.homol     : A text file listing all the homologs to the target (one PDB\_ID per line).

The script ``scripts/install_dependencies.py`` can be used to install some of Flib's dependencies.

An example of each of these files for protein 1AIU can be found in the folder *examples*.

On top of the required input files, Flib also requires a local version of the Protein Data Bank (PDB). All the ".pdb" files should be grouped under the
same folder and their IDs should be in lower case. 

Local versions of the following software can be incorporated into Flib's pipeline:

1. PSIPRED
2. HHSearch/HHBlits
3. SPIDER-2
4. BLAST

The script ``scripts/install_dependencies.py`` can be used to install some of Flib's dependencies.

To generate a SAINT2-compliant library, the Python script ``scripts/process_new.py`` should be executed. This script requires Python 2.6 or higher and the Biopython Module.

3. CONFIGURATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to configure Flib, alter the path names on the file ``runflibpipeline``.

Make sure to provide the correct paths to Flib and to the local version of the PDB.

4. RUNNING FLIB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To generate fragment libraries for protein structure prediction using Flib, you should use the script ``runflibpipeline`` as follows:

.. code:: bash
   
   $> export FLIB=<PATH TO FLIB>
   $> $FLIB/runflibpipeline 1AIU

The following example should generate the fragment library file "1AIU.lib".

5. RUNNING FLIB AMPLE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate fragment libraries for molecular replacement using Flib, you should use the script ``run_flib_ample_pipeline`` as follows:

.. code:: bash

   $> export FLIB=<PATH TO FLIB>
   $> export PDB=<PATH TO YOUR LOCAL INSTALLATION OF THE PDB>
   $> $FLIB/run_flib_ample_pipeline 1AIU

The following example should generate the fragment library file "1AIU.lib_reduced".
